# Simulation Overview:
The user wakes up in a dark place, unaware of how they got there. They are greeted by a bot called BobBot. As the lights flicker on, the user sees an unknown door. Upon entering, they find themselves inside Bobâ€™s Discount Furniture. The user can purchase anything in the store, including tables and chairs. After selecting a product, they realize they have the exact money to pay for it. The user is then guided back to the door, only to be thrown into darkness once again.
