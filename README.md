# An overview of this simulation:
The user wakes up in a dark place, unaware of where and how they were there. Later, they were greeted by a bot called BobBot. As the lights flickered on, the user is greeted by an unknown door. As the door opens, the user was inside Bob's Discount Furniture. The user is given the option to purchase anything in the store, including tables and chairs. After selecting a product, the user realizes that they had the exact money to pay for the furniture. The user is then guided to the door once again, only to realize that they were going to be thrown into the darkness once again.
